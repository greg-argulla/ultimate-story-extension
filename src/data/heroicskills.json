    "description": "When you summon an Arcanum, you may decide to spend 1 Fabula Point and spend half of your current Hit Points (rounded down) to shape your lifeforce into a full manifestation of their power. If you do, the Arcanum manifests as a soldier-rank creature of the demon Species under your control (they count as an ally and have their own independent turn during conflicts – if you use this Skill during a conflict scene, the Arcanum joins the scene at the end of the current round). You also do not gain any of the merge benefits you would normally enjoy when summoning that Arcanum.The summoned creature has the following profile: Level is equal to your level (thus gaining the bonuses to Checks and damage listed under steps 8 on page 303 of the Core Rulebook). A d10 in one Attribute of your choice, and a d8 in all other Attributes. Maximum Hit Points equal to【twice the creature’s base Might die size, plus half of your maximum Hit Points】. The creature has no Mind Points. Resistance to two damage types of your choice. The creature receives all the merge benefits the Arcanum would normally grant you when summoned (damage Affinities, immunity to status effects, increased Attribute sizes, etc.). If a merge benefit would cause the Arcanum to be dismissed, this will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points. A melee basic attack whose Accuracy Check relies on two different Attributes of your choice and deals【HR + 8】physical damage. Choose two different options: the attack is a ranged attack; or it deals 4 extra damage; or it deals damage of a type other than physical; or the Accuracy Check relies on a single Attribute. The creature may perform the Skill action to produce one of the dismiss effects normally granted by that Arcanum, but doing so will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points. The following rules apply when you Grand Summon an Arcanum: The creature is always summoned at full Hit Points, with no status effects. The creature vanishes if it reaches 0 Hit Points, if you die, lose consciousness or leave the scene, or if you summon or Grand Summon an Arcanum again. The creature also vanishes when a scene ends, or if you simply command them to do so (this will not trigger the corresponding Arcanum’s dismiss effect). Take note of all choices made for Attributes and basic attack during the first time Summon a given Arcanum: these choices will remain unchanged whenever you Grand Summon that same Arcanum again in the future."
