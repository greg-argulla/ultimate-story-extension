  "arcana": "When you summon an Arcanum, you gain its merge benefits; those benefits last until the Arcanum is dismissed (see below). You cannot summon an Arcanum while already merged with one; you must first dismiss the current Arcanum. DISMISSING AN ARCANUM - An Arcanum can be dismissed in several ways: *Once the current scene ends, all Arcana are automatically dismissed. *If you die or fall unconscious while merged with an Arcanum, they are dismissed. *If you leave the scene while merged with an Arcanum, they are dismissed. *You may willingly dismiss your Arcanum: this doesn't require an action, but during a conflict it can only be done on your turn, before or after an action. DISMISS EFFECTS - Most Arcana have a powerful dismiss effect, which may only be activated when you willingly dismiss the Arcanum as described above — if the Arcanum is dismissed for any other reason, the dismiss effect cannot be triggered. If the dismiss effect of an Arcanum deals damage, it will deal 10 extra damage if you are level 20 or higher, or 20 extra damage if you are level 40 or higher. You are also free to ignore the dismiss effect if you don't want to use it. DOMAINS -Each Arcanum is associated with a few key concepts or domains. The Game Master should use these to establish the trials needed to bind the Arcanum, and to adjudicate Rituals performed through the Ritual Arcanism Skill. If you create new Arcana for your world, make sure to associate them with domains that allow for interesting Rituals.",
